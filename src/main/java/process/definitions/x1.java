 * Marker interface. It is implemented in the definition (mathematics operation) classes, where this variable is needed.
 * For ex., class Square requires only one variable x1, so this class implements only interface x1.
 * And another ex., class Multiplication requires variable x1 and variable x2, so this class implements both of interfaces (x1 and x2).
 * If necessary, we can create other interfaces (x3, x4 ...) and use them in the above way.
